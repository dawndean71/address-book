To test application follow these steps:

1. Go to this url : https://address-book-24c0f.web.app/

2. Create an account. This account will retain your contact list. When you close the app and sign in again, your information will still be there.

3. After logging on/creating an account, add a contact but clicking on the "+" icon. You will be redirected to the createContact page.

4. Insert the contact information and click "Save". 
side note: I tried to validate the email and password fields but it just wasn't working out - I left the code there (in CreateContact.js) if you want to take a look.

5. After clicking "Save" a disclaimer will pop up informing you that the contact has been saved into local storage.

6. Click the back arrow key "<--" at the top left of the navbar to see the contact you have just added.

7. If you would like to "Delete" this contact or any other contact, click on the red delete icon to the right of the contact card. You will be informed that the contact has been removed. 

8. If you would like to "Edit", you unfortunately can't because it does not work. You will receive an error message stating that "something is wrong...".

9. I also did not complete the upload photo part of the test.
